# 6 Visualização de dados

## **Importância dos gráficos**

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

### Melhor forma de **apresentar** e **discutir** seus dados

--

### Faz uma **síntese** para melhor entendimento

--

### Necessário em quase todas as **análises estatísticas**

--

### Necessário em quase todas as **publicações**, trabalhos de consultoria, TCC, dissertação, tese 

---

# 6.1 Principais pacotes para gráficos no R

## Atualmente, há três principais pacotes para gerar gráficos no R:

--

### **1 base**: simples, porém útil para visualizações rápidas de quase todos os formatos de arquivos `plot()`

--

### **2 ggplot2**: complexos, demandam certo tempo para realização, mas ficam exelentes para publicação `ggplot() +`

--

### **3 plotly**: medianos, gráficos móveis, podem ser utilizados em apresentações para "arrastar" ou "zoom" `plo_ly()`

# 6.1 Principais pacotes para gráficos no R

## **base**

### Default no R, funcionando com o pacote **graphics**

--

### Pode ser utilizado para arquivos de **diversas classes**

--

### Possui funções como:

`plot()`&lt;br&gt;
`hist()`&lt;br&gt;
`barplot()`&lt;br&gt;
`boxplot()`&lt;br&gt;
`abline()`&lt;br&gt;
`points()`&lt;br&gt;
`lines()`&lt;br&gt;
`polygon()`&lt;br&gt;
